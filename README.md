# 3D-printed Six Axis Robotic Arm
This repository contains everything you need to make an (almost) completely 3D-printed six axis robotic arm. The robotic arm makes use of six BLDC motors. They are controlled by three ODrives (two motors per ODrive) and those ODrives are controlled by a ROS network.

The gear reductions are planetary gear sets and are also printed. Big shoutout to **Gear_Down_For_What**  (https://www.thingiverse.com/gear_down_for_what/designs) for providing the basic planetary gear design. I altered it to make it work in my robot.

The design is made using SolidWorks.

This robotic arm was developed as a final project for high school.
